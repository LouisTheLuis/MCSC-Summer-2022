    "* **1.** Set a technical background dedicated to explain why do we need a model for molecular dynamics, and what is the issue in question that has pushed us to choose coarse-graining.\n",
    "* **2.** Explain the MARTINI model in some amount of detail; this is the feature representation that we are using and the one that is going to go into our program.\n",
    "* **3.** Make a short overview of our implementation, and then, give a relationship between our ML model and the force fields that we chose.\n",
