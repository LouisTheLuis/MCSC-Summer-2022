    "### Meeting (6/27/2022 - 2:00pm)\n",
    "During this meeting we reviewed the architectures proposed by all three of us. The idea was that each one of us would propose two architectures:\n",
    "* One *low-data*/*short-term* architecture which would be used with a small toy data-set, whose purpose would be to test our machine learning approaches to generate new polymers with certain characteristics pertaining to a previously known set of molecules â€”such as cellulose acetate, for example.\n",
    "* One *big-data*/*long-term* architecture, which would generalize the approach to a large data set with many polymers to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into the details of what each one of us did, it is important to point out the proposed *data set* to use for the upcoming project development. Neil brought up that, as **PolyInfo** will not be available for a while, we will be forced to use **PI1M**, which stands for PolyInfo one million. The information regarding this particular data set is very flimsy; it does in one hand contain more than 1 million polymers. In the other hand:\n",
    "* The data contained in this database might not be trusted due to their methodology not being particularly the best.\n",
    "* It is likely that the database does not contain the information that we want. It might however, serve as a useful toy data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will look into each other's architectures:\n",
