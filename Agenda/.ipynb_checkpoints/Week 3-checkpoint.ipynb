    "During this meeting we reviewed the architectures proposed by all three of us. The idea was that each one of us would propose two architectures:\n",
    "* One *low-data*/*short-term* architecture which would be used with a small toy data-set, whose purpose would be to test our machine learning approaches to generate new polymers with certain characteristics pertaining to a previously known set of molecules â€”such as cellulose acetate, for example.\n",
    "* One *big-data*/*long-term* architecture, which would generalize the approach to a large data set with many polymers to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into the details of what each one of us did, it is important to point out the proposed *data set* to use for the upcoming project development. Neil brought up that, as **PolyInfo** will not be available for a while, we will be forced to use **PI1M**, which stands for PolyInfo one million. The information regarding this particular data set is very flimsy; it does in one hand contain more than 1 million polymers. In the other hand:\n",
    "* The data contained in this database might not be trusted due to their methodology not being particularly the best.\n",
    "* It is likely that the database does not contain the information that we want. It might however, serve as a useful toy data set.\n",

    "* In the last meeting we focused on the proposed architectures our group proposed. The one we tended towards was using the bond angles as feature representation.\n",
    "* Paloma opened the *Materials Project* website, with a particular polymer ($Nb_3Os$).\n",
    "* Neil proposed some architectures with more up-to-date literature. This brought some ideas to him that made him reconsider the structure of the current architecture.\n",
    "* Paloma has proposed some crash course in polymer engineering (OCW).\n",
    "* She asks the chemical group to investigate how does the cellulose acetate monomer bond to itself.\n",
    "* Paloma mentioned the architectures with IBM. \n",
    "    * IBM mentioned that they already did a data-based approach\n",
    "    * Mentioned Random Forest; according to Neil, that seems to be outdated, as there are methods that outperform Random Forest\n",

    "* **2.** The paper about *Dielectric Polymer Property Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks with Optimizations*, in which the authors write on advances they made on the prediction of dielectric properties of polymers using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). They used multiple strategies (SMILES Fingerprint representations, backpropagation through ATransformedBP and iRPROP). The SMILES representation turned out to be the best in training and prediction performance.\n",

    ">* **1.** 2022-based approaches. We take a polymer and put it through a Message Passign Neural Network (MPNN). The results are very good, and it lines up with our intuiton because we are looking at how polymers bond to themselves.\n",
    ">* **2.** May 2022 -> They took the monomer as a repeating unit and made it bond to itself in a repeating manner. They made the graph periodic in nature and loop to itself, and then pass it through a MPNN. They found significant gains in predictions: atomization error went down, decreases for around 40%-19% in some properties and increases of ~3% (insignificant, one of them was crystallization energy). An overall ~20% decreaser error. It does not, however, encapture 3D data or entanglement.\n",

    ">* PI1M is not a possible data-set, unfortunately. The data set does not contain any polymer propeties; just the list of properties.\n",
    ">* The BigSMILES for describing structure-identifying macromolecules. It might be interesting depending on which monomer representation you use. It does not do 3D representation for these macromolecules. You could represent polymerization points.\n",
    ">* Paloma mentions that we need to understand why these researchers were looking for something different from the original SMILES.\n",
    ">* Backtracking to an IBM paper. They mentioned using feature vector for the inverse molecular design. If we used the Deep RL method. Could not find much; written in a very confusing way."
