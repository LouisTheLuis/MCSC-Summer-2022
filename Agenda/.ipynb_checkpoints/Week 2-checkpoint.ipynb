    "In particular, the problems we came across can be summarized below:\n",
    "* First of all, there is a large limitation to the extent to which we can predict the properties of the molecules. We do not have any particularly extensive QSPR methods from which we can derive some functional results. Molecular dynamics are still a very large limitation on what we want to obtain.\n",
    "* There was a brief mention of using molecular bonds as a feature representation. This might be useful for molecular dynamics but the extent to which it is is very unknown.\n",
    "* Polymers fold the more monomers are added to them. How do we make our ML model account for this in order to obtain a computationally feasible model that also takes into account molecular dynamics in a feasible way?"
