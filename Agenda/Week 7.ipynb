    ">* They describe a couple of changes made to the original MARTINI 2.0 model for adapting it to carbohydrates.\n",
    ">* It is important to note how they describe the fact that the parametrization of the bonded and non-bonded interaction equations are largely dependent on the results of AA simulations (i.e. they draw a trajectory, and try to match the parameters so that we obtain values that are closer to those of the AA simulations).\n",

    "Right now I have a small plan for this. For the implementation of these Force Fields, I have considered the use of at least 4 scripts:\n",

    "* One for the characteristics of the Agent Bead (e.g. Apolar, donor and 4 in polarization scale)\n",
    "* Another one for the bonded potential functions; which must then be translated into physics\n",

    "* RL functionality\n",

    "Let's start with the CG characteristics of the Agent bead. The idea is to have two characteristics to each bead.\n",

    "string beadType;        // Whether the bead is Charged (Q), Apolar (A), Polar (P), or Semipolar (N)\n",
    "string beadSubType;     // The level of polarity of each bead (it is from low 1 to high 5) \n",
    "                        // or whether the bead is a donor (d), acceptor (a), both (da), or none (0)\n",
    "```\n",
