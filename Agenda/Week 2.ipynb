Unfortunately this meant the loss of multiple summaries of PDFs and detailed notes of previous meetings. This week thus, contains <i>very</i> limited information. I apologize (to myself) for not being careful with Git. Hopefully one day I will rewrite these summaries if they are really that important.\n",

    "During this meeting two people presented about the literature that they read. They were Elena Garza and Jehan Ahmed —both presenting about QSPR methods and other chemical interesting subjects— and Andrew Emmel, who presented on the Random Forest paper. Unfortunately, the slides are not available and the minutes over the presentation were lost."
