    ">**Important Points:**\n",
    ">* *Context:* Recent years have seen the development of techniques to synthesize polymers. However, limitations in the design approaches and cost-time issues related to monomer sequence-structure-property has made it difficult to make much progress.\n",
    ">* However, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations and machine learning (ML) algorithms have allowed establishing the structure-function correlation of polymer chains.\n",
    ">* The chemical structure of monomers, as well as their arrangements, govern the properties of polymer from microstructures to physical and mechanical behaviors. For instance, conductivity, elasticity, rigidity or biodegradability can be calibrated by the sequence-defined polymers.\n",
    ">* Since polymers are long-chain molecules, their size effect typically originates form their molecular weight than from the monomer size. Furthermore, the inter- and intra-molecular interactions beyween polymer chains can lead to very different microstructures, such as phase separation and crystallization; influencing thermal and mechanical properties dramatically.\n",
    ">* Among many molecular dynamics' techniques, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) rather than all-atom modeling can serve as an effective approach for reducing tremendously computational cost and complexity of chemical space while maintaining accuracy.\n",
    ">* Common theories in polymer simulations include field-theoretic computer simulatio (FTCS), self-consistent-field-theory (SCFT)/density functional theory (DFT), dynamic mean-field theory (DMFT), integral equation polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM).\n",
    ">* Of these theories, PRISM is particularly interesting. It describes the liquid-like structural correlations in single- and multi-component polymer melts, solutions, nanocomposites, and complex fluid systems. The theory uses \"closure relations\" to reflect pairwise interaction potentials acting between components. However, the methods has some limitations: it cannot be directly applied to materials different from the liquid-like system and can be extremely slow to converge.\n",
    ">* ML tools in the field of polymers faces some limitations: **1.** Dataset availability **2.** Ease for interpretation and **3.** Transferability.\n",
    ">* *Course-grained technique:* \n",
    ">    * **1.** Map the small groups of atoms from the all-atom (AA) simulation to the beads. The number of heavy atoms per bead represents the level of coarse-graining.\n",
    ">    * **2.** The interactions between beads are defined by two approaches: bottom-up, where we adopt the AA simulation as reference to derive the force fields or interactions between CG beads; and top-down, where the force field of CG beads is tuned from macroscopic experimental observation. Most famous one: the MARTINI model, with 4-to-1 mapping. Another model is the mesoscopic particle-based model or dissipative particle dynamics (DPD).\n",
    ">    * **3.** Choose a thermodynamics ensemble —it will depend on the purpose and the experimental conditions. The microcanonical statistical-mechanical ensemble or NVE is a common one.\n",
    ">* The paper goes over some ML methods: Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Generative Models (GANs and VAEs), Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Pareto Active Learning.\n",
    ">* In the use of CGMD coupled ML models, which ML algorithm is efficiently used when it comes to sequential data? → LSTM-RNN (a method from NLP) could be useful.\n",
    ">* The paper goes over multiple examples of ML coupled with CGMD. It finishes by raising some questions: how many CGMD data-points will be sufficient for the ML training process? How do we featurize molecules effectively for CGMD/ML coupling? Which topology to use?\n",

    ">**Important Points:**\n",
    ">* Typical crude oil will be made of thousands of different chemical species, of similar chemical nature but varying in molecular size, morphology, and thermophysical behaviour. \n",
    ">* It just isn't possible to model these complex systems by taking all distinct molecules in the system into account. Thus, two schemes have become mainstream tools to model these mixtures: either the description as a continuum distribution, or the description as a discrete but finite set of pseudo-components.\n",
    ">* However, classical molecular simulations have risen as a modern approach to study thermophysical properties of fluid mixtures. \n",
    ">* The approach made by these researchers consists on employing a molecular-based Equation of State (EoS) to parametrize a force field that can be employed in molecular simulations.\n",
    ">* The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) is a perturbation theory usef to describe quantitatively the volumetric properties of fluids. There are many versions, all of which differ on the underlying intermolecular potential employed to describe the unbounded particles. The current work focuses on SAFT-VR Mie → SAFT-γ, which describes the macroscopical properties of the Mie potential of the form $\\phi(r) = C\\epsilon[(\\frac{\\sigma}{r})^{\\lambda_r}-(\\frac{\\sigma}{r})^{\\lambda_a}]$ \n",
    ">* In the CG application of the SAFT models one considers spherical elements that corresponds to a chemical moiety comprised of several atoms. These coarse-grained models do not provide information on the intramolecular interactions, as these are all averaged out during the fitting procedure.\n",
    ">* The SAFT CG simulations are able to predict the phase behaviour of light crude oil mixtures and allow the simulation of reasonably large systems. This is enough to observe complex dynamics like cluster formation and phase segregation.\n",

    ">    * **1.** Interaction Sites: 4-to-1 mapping (i.e. on average four heavy atoms are mapped to a single center; different for ring structures). Only consider 4 types of interaction sites: polar (P), nonpolar (N), apolar (C), and charged (Q). Each types has several subtypes; by hydrogen-bonding capabilities or degree of polarity.\n",
    ">    * **2.** Nonbonded Interactions: Shifted Lennard-Jones (LJ) 12-6 potential energy functions is used to describe the nonbonded interactions $$U_{LJ}(r) = 4\\epsilon_{ij}[(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r})^{12}-(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r})^6]$$ where $\\sigma_{ij}$ represents the closest distance of approach between two particles and $\\epsilon_{ij}$ the strength of their interaction.

    ">    * **4.** Ring Particles: Includes as many CG sites as necessary in order to keep the ring geometry, typically resulting in a 2 or 3 to 1 mapping of ring atoms onto CG beads.\n",
    ">    * **5.** Antifreeze Particles: An antifreeze agent is used to prevent the unwanted freezing of the CG water.  They interact as a special particle type denoted $BP_4$.\n",
    ">    * **6.** Simulation Parameters: The simulations were performed with the GROMACS simulation package version 3.0. \n",
    ">    * **7.** Interpretation of Time Scale: In comparison to atomistic models, the dynamics observed with CG models is faster as the underlying energy landscape is much smoother as a result of larger particle sizes.\n",
    ">    * **8.** Topologies: Solvents, Ions, Phospholipids, and Cholesterol are modelled in particular configurations.\n",
    ">* *Results:* improved behavior of lipid bilayrs in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and its tendency to form pores. Accurate agreement with all atom simulations for free energy of lipid desorption and (to a lesser extent) flip-flopping across the bilayer.\n",
    ">* *Limitations:* The model has been parametrized for the fluid phase, and thus, properties of solids such as crystal packing are not expected to be accurate. The thermodynamic behavior of solid/fluid and gas/fluid is problematic too. The inherent entropu loss on CG is compensated by a reduced enthalpy term."
